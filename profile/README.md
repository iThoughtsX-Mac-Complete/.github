## Overview

iThoughtsX provides professional mind mapping that transforms how you capture, organize, and develop ideas. Visual thinking through mind maps reveals relationships and structures that linear notes obscure, making iThoughtsX valuable for brainstorming, project planning, meeting notes, and any scenario where understanding connections between concepts matters.

Mind map creation builds hierarchical diagrams radiating from central topics through branches representing related ideas. The visual structure naturally organizes information while remaining flexible enough to capture free-flowing thought during brainstorming sessions.

Formatting options customize appearance extensively with colors, icons, images, and styles that make maps both informative and visually engaging. Different formatting for different branch levels creates visual hierarchy that aids comprehension.

Task management integration adds dates, priorities, and progress tracking to map topics. Transform brainstorming into actionable project plans without switching to separate task applications.

Attachments and links connect external resources to map topics. Reference documents, websites, and files directly from relevant map locations. The connections keep supporting materials accessible within map context.
